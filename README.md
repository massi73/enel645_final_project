## Abstract

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex decision-making problems. This study focuses on applying Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) enhanced with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the Puddle World environmentâ€”a challenging continuous state-space benchmark. By leveraging CNNs for state representation, the DQN agent effectively learns optimal navigation policies while avoiding penalties from puddles. The agent's performance is evaluated across five distinct configurations, demonstrating adaptability and improved generalization capabilities. The results highlight the efficacy of CNN-based state representation in continuous environments and provide insights into challenges related to reward shaping and feature extraction in RL.
